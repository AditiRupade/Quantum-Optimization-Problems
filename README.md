## TSP-Optimization-using-QAOA

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a known NP-complete problem especially to computer scientists and mathematicians. The problem states that "There is a salesman who is travelling from one city to another to sell something. The goal is to find the shortest path between the cities so that the salesman will be able travel all the cities and return back in as much least time as possible".
Given the statement above, this project will aim to reduce the travel time of the salesman using an Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
